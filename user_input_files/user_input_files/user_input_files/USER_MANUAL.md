**Q: Is my personal information secure?**
A: Yes, we take privacy seriously. We use industry-standard encryption and security measures to protect your data. See our Privacy Policy for details.

### Quiz Questions

**Q: How many times can I retake a quiz?**
A: This depends on the quiz settings set by the creator. Some quizzes allow unlimited attempts, others may limit you to 1-3 attempts.

**Q: Can I pause a quiz and come back later?**
A: Yes, most quizzes auto-save your progress. However, timed quizzes may continue counting down even if you leave the page.

**Q: What happens if my internet disconnects during a quiz?**
A: Your answers are auto-saved regularly. When you reconnect, you can usually continue where you left off, though you may lose any unsaved progress.

**Q: Can I see the correct answers after completing a quiz?**
A: This depends on the quiz settings. Many quizzes show results immediately, while others may hide answers until after a deadline.

**Q: How is my score calculated?**
A: Scores are typically based on the number of correct answers out of total questions. Some quizzes use weighted scoring where different questions are worth different points.

### Forum Questions

**Q: How do I ask a good question in the forum?**
A: Be specific, provide context, use proper tags, include examples if relevant, and search to make sure your question hasn't been asked before.

**Q: Can I edit my forum posts after submitting?**
A: Yes, you can usually edit posts for a limited time after submission. Look for an "Edit" button on your posts.

**Q: What's the difference between upvoting and marking an answer as accepted?**
A: Upvoting shows appreciation for helpful content. Marking as accepted (available to question askers) indicates the answer solved their specific problem.

**Q: How do I report inappropriate content?**
A: Look for a "Report" button on posts or comments. You can also contact moderators directly with specific concerns.

**Q: Can I follow specific topics or users?**
A: Yes! You can follow users to see their activity and follow topics to get notifications about new posts in subjects you're interested in.

**Q: Can I use mathematical notation in my answers?**
A: Yes, many questions support LaTeX mathematical notation. Look for a math editor or LaTeX support indicators.
