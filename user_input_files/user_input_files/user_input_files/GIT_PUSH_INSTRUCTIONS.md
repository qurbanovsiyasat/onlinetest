# 🚀 GitHub Push Instructions

## ✅ Project Status
Your Squiz project is ready to be pushed to GitHub at: **https://github.com/qurbanovqurbanov/test.git**

## 📋 Current Situation
- ✅ All changes are committed locally
- ✅ Git remote is properly configured
- ⏳ Authentication required to push to GitHub

## 🔑 Required Steps to Complete Push

### Option 1: Manual Push (Recommended)
1. Open your terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/squiz-project
   ```
3. Push the changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Enter your GitHub credentials when prompted:
   - **Username**: Your GitHub username
   - **Password**: Your GitHub personal access token (not your account password)

### Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)
```bash
gh auth login
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Using SSH (if configured)
If you have SSH keys set up:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:qurbanovqurbanov/test.git
git push origin main
```

## 🔐 GitHub Authentication Notes

### Personal Access Token Required
GitHub no longer accepts account passwords for authentication. You need a **Personal Access Token**:

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate a new token with `repo` permissions
3. Use this token as your password when prompted

### Token Permissions Needed
- ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
- ✅ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows - if needed)

## 📊 What Will Be Pushed

## 🎯 After Successful Push

Your project will be updated on GitHub and accessible at:

### Next Steps
1. Verify the push was successful by visiting the GitHub repository
2. Check that all files are present
3. Consider setting up GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)
4. Share the repository with collaborators if needed

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Authentication Failed**: Ensure you're using a Personal Access Token, not your account password
- **Permission Denied**: Check that you have write access to the repository
- **Remote Rejected**: Someone else may have pushed changes; try `git pull` first then push again

### Getting Help
- GitHub Documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication
